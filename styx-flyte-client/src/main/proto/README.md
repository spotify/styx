# Protos

Styx uses these grpc and protobuf definitions to build the client and communicate with Flyte.

The definitions are taken from the [flyteidl repo](https://github.com/lyft/flyteidl/tree/master/protos/flyteidl) and are built locally.

## TODO
- Add process to upgrade the protobuf definitions.
